# Theia - Web Tracking Visualised

Theia is an interactive web application specifically crafted to enhance transparency in the domain of web tracing. 
It aims to illustrate complex aspects of web tracking in an accessible and user-friendly manner, thereby fostering foundational understanding among a diverse  user base. 

This application is a prototype developed as part of a master's thesis. As such, bugs are to be expected. Feel free to help out by reporting any bugs or issues you come across in the issue tracker!

## Components

Theia is designed to ensure a seamless and coherent narrative covering different topics within the domain of web tracking.
Each of the four main topics is divided into several subtopics. The content is structured progressively, with each piece of information building on the last, guiding users on a comprehensive journey through the central theme of web tracking. The narrative structure (and inherently also the component structure) of the application is illustrated in the figure below:
